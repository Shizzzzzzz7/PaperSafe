# ðŸ“‚ Downloads Directory

## Overview

This directory temporarily holds files during their download process from the cloud storage. Files are stored here briefly while they are being processed and then served to users.

## Structure

downloads/<br/>
  â””â”€â”€ README.md


## Usage

1. **Download Handling**: Files are downloaded from the cloud and saved temporarily in this directory before being served to users. This allows for any pre-download processing such as encryption or formatting.
2. **Cleanup**: Files in this directory should be deleted after being served to the user. It is essential to implement a cleanup mechanism to avoid accumulation of temporary files.

## Important Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure that files in this directory are not publicly accessible to avoid unauthorized access.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage failed downloads and ensure that files in this directory are appropriately removed or retried.
- **File Naming**: Use unique file names to prevent conflicts and ensure traceability.

## Example

Hereâ€™s how a typical file download might be handled:

1. User requests a file via your frontend.
2. The backend retrieves the file from the cloud and saves it temporarily in the `downloads` directory.
3. Perform any necessary processing on the file (e.g., decryption, formatting).
4. Serve the file to the user.
5. Delete the file from the `downloads` directory after it has been served.

## Permissions

Ensure that the `downloads
` directory has appropriate permissions to allow file writing and deletion by the server.
